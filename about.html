<h2>Digital corpus of Norwegian medieval Latin - A concordance search</h2>
<p>
The project <i>Digital corpus and dictionary of Norwegian medieval Latin</i> aims at creating a research infrastructure for the study of Latin as used in Norway in the Middle Ages. This is part of a larger, European initiative to document Latin as the common language of Europe in this period. To achieve this, we have first started by digitising all the Norwegian Medieval texts that contain Latin. This has been done as part of Nasjonalbiblioteket's effort to digitise the Norwegian textual heritage. The digital corpus and concordance will in themselves constitute important resources for the study of Norwegian Medieval Latin, but also serve as stepping stones toward the ultimate goal of the project, which is a digital dictionary of Norwegian Latin. We now make available a search in the digital collection of texts that are available so far (the dictionary will be made available at a later stage). The result of a search will be organised in a concordance.

 <p> 
The collection of digital texts contains material in different languages. Texts in other languages than Latin are not proof-read (with the exception of the ones included in <i>Diplomatarium Norvegicum</i>). They are to a large extent OCR-read and should be used with caution.

Some texts recently published are only searchable within the National Library due to copyright restrictions.
